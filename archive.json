The\r\n  three updates are about IPR issues, not organizations or\r\n  structures (see below).  The RFC Editor is discussed in\r\n  Section 2.1 but all that section really does is to point to\r\n  the definition of the Series in RFC 2026 (see below) and to\r\n  a definition of functions and selection procedures in a\r\n  document cited as \"The RFC Editor Charter [G]\". Reference\r\n  [G] reads \"Work in Progress\".\r\n\r\n  Action required: A review of 2028 indicates that it is badly\r\n  outdated and in need of work. It cites documents as \"in\r\n  progress\" for which no progress has been made in close to a\r\n  quarter-century. In some cases, documents that change its\r\n  contents have been published but without any identification\r\n  of their updating 2028. For example, RFC 4844 (and hence the\r\n  later 8729) rather clearly updated the substance of 2028\r\n  even though they are not the \"RFC Editor Charter\" to which\r\n  2028 refers. A quick scan of the IPR documents as\r\n  specifically related to 2028 does not seem to indicate\r\n  anything this group would need to adjust or change but see\r\n  the separate discussion of RFC 8717 (BCP 101) below. Another\r\n  example, while not our problem, is that 2028 still claims\r\n  that the IAB appoints the IETF Chair, text that has never\r\n  been updated.\r\n\r\n  At minimum for us, RFC 2028 should be updated by pointing to\r\n  new structure or charter documents or by pointing to a\r\n  successor for RFC 8729. Preferably, we should convince the\r\n  IESG that an overhaul of 2028 is needed and then just\r\n  incorporate new/ better RFC Editor function references into\r\n  it. For that \"overhaul the whole thing\" option, I sent a\r\n  summary to the gendispatch mailing list over the weekend,\r\n\r\nhttps://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/gendispatch/NZ6QfxWlFvkh7jkHvBwNxKd7TR8/",

See rant above. Section 3.6 (and\r\n  the somewhat redundant Section 5.9) implies that the IETF\r\n  Trust need not (and perhaps does not or should not) own the\r\n  copyrights to Informational RFCs and \"RFCs submitted as RFC\r\n  Editor Contributions\" (not our problem, but, I believe,\r\n  inconsistent with contemporary practice) and suggests (in\r\n  terminology of today's structure) that the authority of the\r\n  Trust is limited to documents \"in the RFC format used by the\r\n  IETF\". Probably not our problem either, but, in the current\r\n  \"only the XML is the canonical/ archival form\" model, it is\r\n  not clear what \"the format used by the IETF\" means. RFC\r\n  8721 sheds no light on this other than noting the\r\n  long-standing tradition of allowing translations and\r\n  suggesting it continue. Terms such as \"published by the RFC\r\n  Editor\" appear in other places, such as Section 4 of RFC\r\n  5378, and points to the \"RFC Editor web page\" for more\r\n  information, where there is no sign of any such information\r\n  (see \"Job Description\" below).\r\n\r\n  Action required: Probably none unless we need the new entity\r\n  to endorse the BCP 78 policies either as an entity\r\n  independent of other IETF-related bodies or as part of an\r\n  RFC Editor Stream should we decide to create one, probably\r\n  following the IAB model outlined in Section 11. Note,\r\n  however, that the other streams have been much more careful\r\n  to apply BCP 79 than they have been about BCP 78 (e.g., as\r\n  I read the IRTF summary cited above, it is entirely about\r\n  BCP 79 and disclosures -- BCP 78 is not cited or\r\n  mentioned), a problem that is further complicated by the\r\n  slightly convoluted language in RFC 5378 about non-IETF\r\n  documents. In addition, if one were to endorse/ require\r\n  conformance along the lines of BCP 78, it is not clear that\r\n  its definition of \"Contribution\" would work for the sort of\r\n  discussions I think we are assuming would occur in the\r\n  working group or oversight body.",

If there are multiple people, take it up with each of the respective bodies separately.  Each of those bodies has their own higher authority also, so failed appeals can be escalated further in the extreme.\r\n\r\nThe basis for appeals though needs to be clear: this only occurs because the assertion is that the RSAB has not acted in the interest of their stream or that the process was not followed (unnecessary delays in producing a position, that sort of thing).\r\n\r\nAppeals should be made to the body formally, with the RSAB being notified (either by the appellant or the body that receives the appeal, it matters not).  The appeal should be dealt with in a timely fashion (1 month seems appropriate).\r\n\r\nI assume that this relates to approvals; if there are problems with chairs, I think that the logical appeal path is to the RSAB - or the body that appoints chairs.",

      "body": "Opened as one issue. We can split out parts that people disagree on.\r\n\r\n\r\nAbstract\r\n\r\nI think that the Abstract is too minimalist. The single sentence is a\r\nfine thing to say, but the Abstract should contain some text similar to\r\nthat in 8728.\r\n\r\nThe Abstract should also include a statement of obsoleting 8728. So,\r\nsomething like...\r\n\r\n  Documents in the Request for Comments (RFC) series are published on\r\n  behalf of the IETF, the IAB, the IRTF, and the Independent \r\n  Submissions Editor.  In order to provide a sustainable basis for \r\n  continued publication of the RFC series, this document describes\r\n  Version 3 of the RFC Editor model, which divides the responsibilities\r\n  for the RFC series among four primary functions: the IETF \r\n  Administration LLC (IETF LLC), the RFC Series Working Group (RSWG),\r\n  the RFC Series Approval Board (RSAB), and the RFC Publication Center\r\n  (RPC).\r\n\r\n  This document reflects the experience gained with versions 1\r\n  and 2 of the RFC Editor Model documented in RFC 5620 and RFC 8728,\r\n  and obsoletes RFC 8728.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nIntroduction\r\n\r\nI feel that the Introduction is a bit thin. While we probably don't need\r\na whole lot of text, some background about the series and the rfc editor\r\nfunction is probably helpful. We can lean a lot on RFC 8729. We should \r\nalso describe the manner of obsoleting RFC 8728 (i.e., the changes).\r\n\r\nSomething like... \r\n\r\n  Documents in the Request for Comments (RFC) series have been\r\n  continually published since 1969 [RFC8700].  The RFC series is\r\n  described in [RFC8729].  RFC 8729 uses the term  \"RFC Editor\r\n  function\" or \"RFC Editor\" to identify the collective set of\r\n  responsibilities for publishing documents in the RFC series.\r\n\r\n  The processes and organizational models for publication of these\r\n  documents have changed significantly over the years.  Most recently,\r\n  in 2009, [RFC5620] defined the RFC Editor Model (Version 1), and in\r\n  2012 [RFC6635] defined the RFC Editor Model (Version 2), since \r\n  modified slightly in 2020 by [RFC8728].\r\n\r\n  In order to provide a sustainable basis for continued publication of\r\n  the RFC series, this document describes Version 3 of the RFC Editor\r\n  model, which divides the responsibilities for the RFC series among\r\n  four primary functions: the IETF Administration LLC (IETF LLC), the\r\n  RFC Series Working Group (RSWG), the RFC Series Approval Board\r\n  (RSAB), and the RFC Publication Center (RPC).  This revised model\r\n  remains consistent with RFC 8729.\r\n\r\n  This document obsoletes RFC 8728 by making a full update to the RFC\r\n  Editor model, changing the responsibilities of existing bodies and\r\n  functions, and introducing new functions.  Specific changes from the\r\n  version 2 RFC Editor Model are presented in Section 7.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThere are two cases of 2119 \"MUST\" in the document. I don't understand \r\nwhy those cases are specifically called out for special treatment when\r\nother \"must\" and \"should\" remain in lower case. I would suggest moving \r\neverything to lower case and removing Section 2.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nSection 3 has\r\n\r\n  The IETF LLC shall also provide a structure for defining policies\r\n  regarding the RFC series.  This document specifies such a structure\r\n  through a new RFC Series Working Group (RSWG), which shall submit its\r\n  policy proposals to a new RFC Series Approval Board (RSAB).\r\n\r\nWell, either this document defines the structure (which is subject to\r\ncommunity consensus) or the LLC defines the structure. Maybe,\r\n\r\n  The IETF LLC shall also facilitate and support a structure, specified\r\n  in this document, for defining policies regarding the RFC series.  \r\n  That structure is based on a new RFC Series Working Group (RSWG), \r\n  which shall submit its policy proposals to a new RFC Series Approval\r\n  Board (RSAB).\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nSection 4\r\n\r\n  Continuing publication of RFCs shall be handled by the RFC Production\r\n  Center (RPC) function in accordance with current policies in force or\r\n  future policies defined as specified in the next section of this\r\n  document.\r\n\r\nI stumbled over \"policies defied as specified...\". I think you mean \r\n\"policies defined following the process specified...\".\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nSection 4\r\n\r\n  Community members who have concerns about the performance of the RPC\r\n  can request that the IETF LLC look into the matter.  If the IETF LLC\r\n  opts to delegate the oversight function, concerns can be raised with\r\n  the IETF LLC.\r\n\r\nI'm unclear whether this is intended to be a duplication of concern to \r\nbe raised with the LLC, or to be raised with the delegated body. So it \r\nshould be either:\r\n\r\n  Community members who have concerns about the performance of the RPC\r\n  can request that the IETF LLC look into the matter.  Even if the IETF\r\n  LLC opts to delegate the oversight function, concerns should be\r\n  raised with the IETF LLC.\r\n\r\nor:\r\n\r\n  Community members who have concerns about the performance of the RPC\r\n  can request that the IETF LLC look into the matter.  If the IETF LLC\r\n  opts to delegate the oversight function, concerns should be raised \r\n  with the delegee, but can also be raised with the IETF LLC.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n5.1.1\r\n\r\n  subject to intellectual property policies\r\n  which must be consistent with those of the IETF [RFC8179]\r\n\r\nPerhaps this should reference by BCP number (BCP79). Additionally, \r\nshouldn't we also mention BCP78 at the same time.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n5.1.1\r\n\r\n  The IETF Chair and the Independent Submissions Editor shall each\r\n  appoint and oversee a co-chair of the RSWG.\r\n\r\nI am OK with this very open process, but I wanted to check that the\r\ngroup is content to leave it entirely up to each of those two people how\r\nthey make the appointment. Additional constraints might include:\r\n- nominations period\r\n- open feedback period\r\n- length of term\r\n- number of terms\r\n\r\nThis text might usefully include a reference to 8730.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n5.1.1\r\n\r\n  Members of the\r\n  RSAB are also expected to participate actively in the RSWG so that\r\n  they are fully aware of proposals early in the policy definition\r\n  process.\r\n\r\nI believe it was stronger than this. In particular, the discussion \r\nseemed to imply that the intention was that all issues that the RSAB\r\nmembers might have would be raised during normal RSWG discussions and\r\nnot be \"late surprises\" in the RSAB review period. Thus...\r\n\r\n  Members of the\r\n  RSAB are expected to participate actively in the RSWG so that they \r\n  are fully aware of proposals early in the policy definition process\r\n  and so that any issues or concerns that they have will be raised \r\n  during the development of the proposals and will not be left until\r\n  the RSAB review period as described in Section 5.2.1.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n5.1.2\r\n\r\n  o  The RFC Series Editor/Advisor\r\n\r\nI suggest a forward pointer to Section 6.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n5.1.2\r\n\r\ns/THE RSAB/The RSAB/\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n5.1.2\r\n\r\nI would like to raise the issue of whether the designated voting members\r\nmay appoint delegates. For example (and not to imply anything about\r\nanyone) the IETF chair might be considered to already be very busy with\r\nenough tasks to occupy their time: they might prefer to be able to\r\nappoint a delegate to fill this position for them.\r\n\r\n(It is possible that this is contained int he existing OPEN ISSUE, but I\r\ndon't read it that way.)\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n5.2.2\r\n\r\ns/A individual/An individual/\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n5.2.2\r\n\r\nThis all looks good, but I wonder whether the WG chairs should be \r\nadditionally charged to advertise proposals that have been adopted to\r\nspecific communities where appropriate. This is suitable vague that it\r\ndoesn't place a heavy burden, but it does point up the responsibility to\r\ncover odd cases. For example (fatuous example: please don't discuss!),\r\nif there was a proposal to stop publishing RFCs that presented security\r\nprofiles preferred by specific governments, one might hope to involve \r\nthe people who have previously authored such documents.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n5.2.3\r\n\r\n  The ISOC Board of Trustees MAY decide only whether a\r\n  process failure occurred, and what if any corrective action should\r\n  take place.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding my previous comment about 2119. This isn't a \"MAY\". It\r\ncould be shaped as \"MUST only.\" Or simply \"may\".\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nGiven that this document obsoletes RFC 8728, we need to be careful \r\nthat we aren't discarding anything we really want to keep.\r\n\r\nSeems to me that there is a fair amount of material about the RPC,\r\nbudget, IANA, and security that we want to retain.\r\n",

      "body": "We can break these out if these is controversy.\r\n\r\nHi,\r\n\r\nOn 2021-4-5, at 22:19, Peter Saint-Andre <stpeter@mozilla.com> wrote:\r\nhttps://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-saintandre-rfced-model/\r\n\r\nI gave this a quick read, below are some initial thoughts.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nLars\r\n\r\nSection 4, paragraph 2, comment:\r\n  Continuing publication of RFCs shall be handled by the RFC Production\r\n  Center (RPC) function in accordance with current policies in force or\r\n  future policies defined as specified in the next section of this\r\n  document.\r\n\r\nI'm not quite sure what \"Continuing publication\" is meant to express - can\r\n\"continuing\" be removed, or else, what does it signify? (Or was the intent to\r\nsay \"Publication ... shall continue to be handled\"?)\r\n\r\nSection 5.1.1, paragraph 1, comment:\r\n5.1.1.  RFC Series Working Group (RSWG)\r\n\r\nCalling this group a Working Group will likely be a constant source of confusion\r\nfor IETF participants that do not pay much attention to organizational\r\ndiscussions, because this group will be significantly different from \"real\" IETF\r\nWGs. I'm wondering if calling it a \"Policy Group\" or by some other name may reduce\r\nthat possibility for confusion.\r\n\r\nSection 5.1.1, paragraph 2, comment:\r\n  The IETF Chair and the Independent Submissions Editor shall each\r\n  appoint and oversee a co-chair of the RSWG.\r\n\r\nI can understand why each separately appoints one chair, but why would each then\r\ncontinue to oversee only the one chair they appointed?\r\n\r\nSection 5.1.2, paragraph 4, comment:\r\n  The voting members of the RSAB shall be as follows:\r\n\r\nAre there members other than voting members on the RSAB? If not, just call them\r\nmembers? If yes, who are they?\r\n\r\nSection 5.1.2, paragraph 7, comment:\r\nIs there an intention for the RSAB to gain additional (voting) members\r\nif new RFC streams are created in the future?\r\n\r\nSection 5.2.2, paragraph 18, comment:\r\n  1.  If a CONCERN exists, discussion will take place within the RSWG.\r\n      Again, all RSAB members MUST participate.\r\n\r\nThis is an unenforceable MUST.\r\n\r\nSection 5.2.2, paragraph 18, comment:\r\n  2.  If all CONCERN positions are addressed, then the proposal is\r\n      approved.  Again, if substantial changes have been made, an\r\n      additional call for community input should be made.\r\n\r\nIt's not quite clear what \"addressed\" means. It would be clearer to say \"A\r\nproposal without any CONCERN positions is approved.\"\r\n\r\nSection 6.1, paragraph 2, comment:\r\n  process in confidence.  The initial length of service shall be for\r\n  one year, but then further extensions will be for three to five\r\n  years.\r\n\r\nIt will IMO be difficult to hire the desired senior professional on a one-year\r\ncontract.\r\n\r\n",

Of\r\ncourse there are gaps and open issues, but I assume we will cover\r\nthem on the list.\r\n\r\nI agree with Adrian's review. One job that needs to be done is to check\r\nthat everything in RFC 8728 is taken care of. That could mean one of at\r\nleast three things for each item:\r\na) abolished (e.g. the RSOC; already covered)\r\nb) replaced (e.g. whatever the RSE/A ends up as)\r\nc) intentionally unspecified (because we should not micro-manage by RFC)\r\n\r\nThe third category might be the hardest, since we all love bikeshedding so\r\nmuch. Maybe there should be an opening statement that details have been\r\navoided wherever possible, to avoid micro-management. So while I agree\r\nwith Adrian that there is valuable material in RFC 8728, I think we\r\nshould prune it wherever it looks like micro-management.\r\n\r\nAgreeing on the RSE/A role appears to be the main gap in the -00 version,\r\nwhich I assume we will discuss here soon enough. I have some concerns\r\nabout \"6.1.  RSEA Selection\" but I think those should be discussed\r\nafter the role is clarified.\r\n\r\nOne specific phrase needs fixing IMHO:\r\n\r\n\"Specifically, this document defines a structure in which ultimate\r\n  authority lies with the IETF LLC...\"\r\n\r\nEr, no.

We need to explicitly decide to redirect some or all of these to the Editorial Stream.
